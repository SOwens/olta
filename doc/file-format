# File Format

Test format is the same litmus tests generated by the DIY tool; however, following immediately after the litmus test itself is a parameter block and end of file marker.
The parameter block starts with a line containing only '-=-=-'.
The file end is marked by a line containing only '=-=-='.
Note that the file end marker is only required for stdin mode.
Parameters are specified by in variable=value syntax.

Below is an example test with parameter block.
The configuration sets the affinity of the test threads, number of runs and number of iterations per-run.
See the 'test-parameters' for full details of available parameters.

## Example

AArch64 example
{
uint64_t x; 0:X5 = x; 1:X5 = x;
0:X0 = 0x1111;
}

P0           | P1           ;
STR X0,[X5]  | LDR X0,[X5]  ;

P0-affinity=0
P1-affinity=1
run=10
iterations=10000
