# Test Parameters

This file describes the parameters which can be set in the parameter block of a test and how they effect the assembly and execution of a test.


## Global Parameters

label           - label to print at beginning of test [""]
runs            - number of test runs [1]
iterations      - number of iterations per test run [100000]
log-debug       - configure level of debug output [1]
debug-asm-dump  - dump assembly for validation and separate compilation [0]
debug-asm-regs  - dump list of assigned registers [0]
addr-dep        - method used for stall address dependencies [addsub]
record-timing   - output cycle timing for tests, requires PMU access [0]
sync            - synchronisation method between test threads [rr]
                  can be round-robin (rr), master-slave (ms) or countdown (cd)
                  see the `sync-methods` file for more details
sync-master     - name of master thread for 'ms' sync
sync-stall      - number of add1 stall instructions to put in sync loop
shared-buffer-size  
                - size in bytes of buffer available to all threads [67108864]
                  must be a power of two


## Memory Location Parameters

These parameters apply to a specific named memory location (MLN).

MLN-stride       - stride bytes between tests [word size of location]


## Thread Parameters

These parameters apply to a specific named thread (TN); however, '*' can also be used to apply the parameter to all threads.
Note that a parameter naming a thread explicitly will override a '*' named parameter for that thread.
See also the `instruction-actions` file for details on how to augment thread instructions.

TN-affinity         - number of the CPU core/thread to bind this thread to
TN-align-loop       - instruction alignment for test loop head [0]
TN-align-test       - instruction alignment for test body [0]
TN-buffer-size      - size of the private buffer for this thread [67108864]
                      must be a power of two
TN-register-shift   - shift register assignment by N registers [0]
TN-sync-stall       - number of add1 stall instruction to add in sync loop
TN-MLN-flush        - flush dcache of this location between tests [0]
                      1 = clean, invalidate and wait
                      2 = invalidate and wait
                      3 = clean and wait
                      4 = clean (inner most) and wait
                      5 = clean, invalidate
                      6 = invalidate
                      7 = clean
                      8 = clean (inner most)
TN-MLN-preload      - preload this location between tests [0]
TN-MLN-prefetch-ldr-type      
                    - request the processor prefetch this location for loads 
                      (1=keep, 2=stream) [0]
TN-MLN-prefetch-ldr-level 
                    - cache level to prefetch loads to (1-3) [0] 
TN-MLN-prefetch-str-type      
                    - request the processor prefetch this location for stores 
                      (1=keep, 2=stream) [0]
TN-MLN-prefetch-str-level 
                    - cache level to prefetch stores to (1-3) [0] 

Note that it is valid to flush, preload and prefetch the same location.
When combinations of these are specified they happen in the order preload, flush, prefetch.
